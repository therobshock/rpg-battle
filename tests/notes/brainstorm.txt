Battle system with basic graphics and animations in place.
It's good but pretty random. There basically can be no effective strategy to win
as winning and losing depends almost entirely on chance. 
Things other games use:
    health potions
    special attacks
    actual AI (or some simulation of AI)
    Character stats that affect action abilities
    Different kinds of actions that provide variety on success

maybe I can make an object array of objects of different opponents that have particular
attributes and give certain actions more weight depending on their 
attributes. 

The opponents are random and you can use special items to maybe lower certain attributes
or choose your actions accordingly. Say that there are characters that are more likely
to use certain actions, like a warrior class will more likely use attack than magic, etc.

Some games use a point system for each action, for example "staminia" points for attack and
"mana" for magic. 

Add bonus point to roll for a particular character's action to increase chance of success
for that attack, for example, a wizard would get a bonus for using magic, warrior for attack, etc.

Character types: 
    Warrior: bonus for attack
    Wizard: bonus for magic
    Ninja: bonus for defend
